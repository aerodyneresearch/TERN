# TERN
Gas chromatography data analysis software

TERN 2.2.20 is the most recent BETA version of TERN, released 28-Apr-2022.

This is the first version of TERN that is compatible with Igor Pro v9.

Otherwise, this is a minor update with some bug fixes and other tweaks. For example, TOF data is now displayed in counts rather than counts / extraction.

As this is a beta release, there may be some stability issues with this version - please let us know and we'll try to address them with you directly. This version is unlikely to receive a patch, as a big update is coming soon with automated peak fitting and other exciting things.

See the [Aerodyne Customer Support website](https://support.aerodyne.com/) for more information and guidance.

Note that the software can be found in the file "TERN_2_2_20.zip". Ignore the Source.zip and Source.tar.gz files which are default created by GitHub.
