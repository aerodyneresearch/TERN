# TERN

Gas chromatography data analysis software

TERN is open-source chromatographic data analysis software, written for Wavemetrics [Lake Oswego, OR] Igor Pro data analysis package, designed to solve chromatographic signal(s) as a set of exponentially-modified Gaussian [EMG] peaks. TERN is designed for atmospheric gas chromatography data, typically collected during field campaigns, but is flexible to work with a broad range of data types.

TERN was first described in:
Automated single-ion peak fitting as an efficient approach for analyzing complex chromatographic data. G. Isaacman-VanWertz, D.T. Sueper, K.C. Aikin, B.M. Lerner, J. B. Gilman, J. A. de Gouw, D.R. Worsnop, and A.H. Goldstein. Journal of Chromatogrpahy, A, 1529(81-92), doi:10.1016/j.chroma.2017.11.005, 2017.

This version of TERN requires Wavemetrics Igor Pro v7 or higher.
